## 1. **Short Description**

#### **Problem**

Seemingly harmless household objects may not seem to be an issue. However a pile up of such objects along corridors or the staircase can actually be a fire hazard and potential cause of fire. More common, unattended open flames in the kitchen is also a great fire hazard. It is therefore imperative to identify such fire hazards and prevent a fire from even breaking out.

#### How technology can help

By programming a device to detect fire hazards through machine learning, an alert will be sent to the relevant stakeholders to inform them of the potential fire hazard in their possession. They will be reminded to address this fire hazard, hence there is reduced likelihood of a fire breaking out. 

#### Team Proposal

Our group proposes to leverage a network of smart infrastructure consisting of an automated fire hazard detection system to spot potential fire hazards.
