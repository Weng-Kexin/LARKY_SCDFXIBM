# (a) Fire hazards like a pile up of objects along the corridor and open flames in a kitchen can lead to a full flown fire. By programming a device to detect such fire hazards through machine learning, our group proposes the use of a automated fire hazard detection system to spot potential fire hazards.
# (b) pitch video*
# (c) architecture of solution: central server -> camera detectors -> cloud storage -> server
# (d) hyperlink to detailed solution*
# (e) Project Roadmap/ Proposed timeline
# (f) Getting started* (Step-by-step instructions to install the required software and how to run a demo of your solution)
# (g) Running the tests (Explanation and breakdown on how to run tests for the proposed solution)
# (h) Live demo (Link to an actual working demo/website)
# (i) What your team used to build your solution* (e.g. IBM Cloudant, IBM Cloud Functions, etc...)
