# **Short Description**
### Fire hazards like a pile up of objects along the corridor and open flames in a kitchen can lead to a full flown fire. By programming a device to detect such fire hazards through machine learning, our group proposes the use of a automated fire hazard detection system to spot potential fire hazards.
