## 1. **Short Description**
#### **Problem**

Fire hazards like a pile up of objects along the corridor and open flames in a kitchen can lead to a full flown fire. 

#### How technology can help

By programming a device to detect fire hazards through machine learning. 

#### Team Proposal

Our group proposes the use of a automated fire hazard detection system to spot potential fire hazards.
